# Nathan Brown-Bennett Portfolio

This repository contains the source for my personal GitHub Pages site. The page automatically lists public repositories from both the `NathanBrownBennett` and `JakkuAzzo` accounts using the GitHub API.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser, or enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings to host it online.
2. Replace the placeholder images in the `assets` directory with your own profile picture and logo.
3. Edit the **About Me** section in `index.html` with information about yourself, such as details from your LinkedIn profile. A placeholder link to `https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanbrown-bennett/` is included in the page header.

The site uses basic CSS animations and fetches repository information dynamically when the page loads.
